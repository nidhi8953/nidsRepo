As you are ware that all these equipments were handled by me and these all are reviewed and closed in Code-1/R as applicable. And majority of the these documents came in DEC-FEB period. Hence due to this, I was not able to prepare Interconnection diagram and started the same from 15/03/2018. As you know that preparation the interconnection diagram requires a dedicated effort, but in the meantime you change the priorities no. of time which resulted in the delay. After submitting HV interconnection to you on 09/04/2018, I have prepared MV Interconnection which is approx. 50-60% complete. But during that time, you only told me to stop that work and start working for MREP (A945) job and the activities given to me are as below which I have already completed:
    a) Eletrical Heater Input
    b) Pre bid queries of 3.3 KV GIS- Already gave you the replies on next day of M/s Siemens and M/s ABB.
    c) Offer evalaution of
